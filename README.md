## Data Visualization by Dashboard: Olympics History
### Project Overview
This project aims to explore the history of the Olympics and provide dynamic insights about the games and sports over time through an interactive dashboard. Leveraging Plotly, the dashboard offers visual representations of Olympic data, including trends, medal counts, and athlete demographics. Additionally, the project utilizes machine learning models to make predictions for individuals seeking to participate in certain games based on their body features, using the Olympics dataset.

### Objectives
- Historical Analysis: Explore the evolution of the Olympics over time, including changes in sports, participation, and medal distribution.
- Interactive Dashboard: Develop a user-friendly dashboard using Plotly and Dash to visualize Olympic data dynamically.
- Machine Learning Predictions: Utilize TensorFlow and Scikit-learn to build predictive models for recommending Olympic sports based on individual body features.
### Tools and Technologies
- TensorFlow: For developing machine learning models to predict Olympic sports based on body features.
- Scikit-learn: For additional machine learning tasks and preprocessing of the dataset.
- Plotly: To create interactive and visually appealing visualizations for the dashboard.
- Dash: For building web-based interactive dashboards to present the visualized data and machine learning predictions.11
